        Welcome Teachers,<br>

        OnTue has Homebase English Teacher all over the world
        and it is nearly impossible to have an orientation for each teacher with the curriculum.<br>

        So, we ask teachers to view this page and learn what are our curriculumns and how to do it.<br>
        




        We have only three official curriculum's.<br>

        1. Level Test.<br>
        If you have a free class. That's the level test class.<br>

        We want teachers follow this step.<br>

        A) Teachers will greet student like 'Hi. How are you? I am xxxx'.
            When a teacher greets, the teacher can quickly gain on the level of student's English.
            For instance, student don't say anything, or student just reply with 'hi' and don't say anything.
            Teacher can continue asking, student name, age, nationality, where he live, what he does.
            But not too long. Greeting should be less than 1 minutes.

            The goal of greeting is to choose what would be the next step.
            
            If the student can speak at all or very clumsy, then do level test with easy one.
            If the student is fluent in English, do level test with some more high level.

        B) Teachers should prepare two kinds of level tests.
            One of beginners.
            One of Advanced.

            Based on the greetings, teacher will choose on of the level tests.

            Level test itself should not take too long. It should be less than 5 or 6 minutes.

            Teachers can ask student to read very short sentence and let them find answers.
